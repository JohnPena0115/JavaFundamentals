Mosh wants us to write a program where we ask the user for
    +their principal => their loan amount
    +the annual interest rate on their loan
    +the duration of their loan

After receiving all this information we would calculate
the user's monthly mortgage payment and display it to
them as a string currency object.

The example template he provided was:

    Principal:
    Annual Interest Rate:
    Period(Years):

    Mortgage:

Equation for Calculating Mortgage Payments
-----------------------------------------

M = mortgage monthly payment
P = principal of loan
R = monthly interest rate
      +Take your annual interest rate and divide it by 12
N = number of total payments required
      +Take the amount of years required to pay off loan
      and multiple by 12


      m = p * ( r(1+r)^n / (1+r)^n - 1)
