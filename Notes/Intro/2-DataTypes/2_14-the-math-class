Useful Methods in the Math Class
--------------------------------

Math.round() => rounds a decimal number to the whole number
                that is closest to the argument provided.
                There are two implementations of Math.round().
                The first implementation takes a float argument
                and returns an int. The second implementation
                takes a double argument and returns a long.

Math.ceil() => takes a decimal number, either a float or double,
               and returns the smallest whole number that is greater
               than the input in the form of a double. So
               Math.ceil(16.0001F) would return 17.0


Math.floor() => returns the mathematical integer (in the form of
                a Java double) that is less than or equal to the
                argument provided. So Math.floor(17.0) returns
                17.0 and Math.floor(17.99999) also returns 17.0.


Math.max() => returns the greater of the two argument values provided.
              Math.max() has 4 implementations. In each implementation,
              the two arguments provided have to be of the same type.
                + max(int a, int b)
                + max(long a, long b)
                + max(float a, float b)
                + max(double a, double b)

Math.random() => generates and returns a random double between 0 and 1
                 exclusive. This means that Math.random() could generate
                 0.0 but it will never generate 1.0. It can however generate
                 a double similar to 0.99999.
