In Java, we use variables to temporarily store data in
the computer's memory.

Variables have 3 components: a type, an identifier and a
value.

So when we write "int age = 30;" we are storing the number 30
somewhere in the computer's memory and we're assigning the label
"age" to that memory location. We are then giving that label
a data type of int.


Best Practices for Declaring Variables
-------------------------------------

Though possible he advises against declaring multiple variables
on the same line:

not advised => int age = 30, temperature = 20;

recommended => int age = 30;
               int temperature = 20;


Naming Convention for Variables
------------------------------

It is best practices to use camelCase notation when
writing out a variable identifier.

In contrast, in Java, class identifiers are written out
with PascalCase notation.
