Java groups data into two categories
    => Primitive types
        +They store simple values.
  and
    => Reference types
        +They store complex objects.


This section is primarily concerned with Primitive types.

Java has 8 primitive types:
    +byte
    +short
    +int
    +long
    +float
    +double
    +char
    +boolean


Byte
----
A byte takes up 1 byte of memory. Within a
byte variable, you can store integer values
from -128 to 127.


Short
-----
A short takes up 2 bytes of memory. Within
a short variable you could store a minimum
integer value of -32,768 and a maximum integer
value of 32,767.


Int
---
An int takes up 4 bytes of memory. Within a int
variable you could store any whole number from
-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.


Long
---
A long takes up 8 bytes of memory and can store whole
value from -2^63  to  2^63 - 1.

Float
-----
Float is one of the two Java data types that can represent
a decimal point number. A float takes up 4 bytes of memory.
Float variables can store values from roughly 1.4^-45
to 3.4^38


Double
------
Double's are the second data type that are used to represent
decimal numbers. A double takes up 8 bytes of memory. The
maximum value of a double is available as the constant
"Double.MAX_VALUE". The minimum value of a double is
not available as "Double.MIN_VALUE" but rather as
"-Double.MAX_VALUE".


Floats and doubles are advised against in calculations where
precision is needed. Calculations involving currency would be
one scenario. In those cases, the java.math.BigDecimal class
is recommended.


Char
----
Char variable's store single characters. A char takes up 2
bytes of data, in part so it can support characters in foreign
languages.

Reminder: '' => for declaring char literals
          "" => for declaring string literals



Boolean
-------
Boolean variables store the values of "true" or "false". Boolean
variables take up 1 byte of data.


Readability of Large Numbers
----------------------------

Java allows us to use underscores to aid in the readability
of large numbers. So, if you want to declare an int that stores
the value of 10 million you could write

int currentSubscribers = 10_000_000;

as oppose to

int currentSubscribers = 10000000;


Declaring Long Variables
----------------------------------

If you write the following Java will throw an exception:

long currentViews = 4_000_000_000;

An exception is thrown because, by default, Java reads any whole
number as an integer. When Java reads "4_000_000_000" it reads
it as an int and correctly deduces that 4_000_000_000 > Integer.MAX_VALUE.
In order to help Java break out of this loop you would need to write
the following:

long currentViews = 4_000_000_000L;

In Java, any whole number being assigned to long variable will
need to have a suffix of "L". Though the suffix can be lower or upper
case, uppercase is advised as a lowercase "l" can easily be misread as
a 1 by a human reader.

Declaring Float Variables
-----------------------------------

Just like Java evaluates any whole number, by default, as an
int, by default, Java evaluates any decimal point number
as a double. If you want to declare a float without Java
throwing an exception you will need to override this default
behavior. If you end a decimal point number with "F", you are
letting Java know, hey, don't evaluate this as a double, evaluate this
as a float.

float price = 10.99; will throw an exception

float price = 10.99F; will make sure Java doesn't rock the boat.
