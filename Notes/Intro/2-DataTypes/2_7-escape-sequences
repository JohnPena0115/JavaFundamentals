In Java, ", ', and \ are special characters. If you want to include
those characters in a string literal you'll need to escape them with
a backslash ...
    \' => escape sequence for single quote
    \" => escape sequence for a double quote
    \\ => escape sequence for a backslash

\n => allows us to a new line to our string
\t => allows us to insert a tab
