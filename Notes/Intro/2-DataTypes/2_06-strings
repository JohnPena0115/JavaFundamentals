The String class is defined in the base java.lang package

Because String is a class, it has members that we can access
using the dot operator(on a object of the String Class). The
methods down below are some of those members:
    +endsWith(String suffix)
    +indexOf(int ch)
    +length()
    +replace(char oldChar, char newChar)

In Java strings are immutable. Because of this, any method
called on a string object will not modified that string but
instead return a new string. The code down below demonstrates
that even after you call replace on message (a string object),
message remains unmodified.

    String message = "Hello World!!";

    System.out.println(message.replace("!", "*"); //=> Hello World**
    System.out.println(message); //=> Hello World!!

Other useful methods/members of the String class
are
  +toLowerCase()
  +toUpperCase()
  +trim()
  +charAt()
