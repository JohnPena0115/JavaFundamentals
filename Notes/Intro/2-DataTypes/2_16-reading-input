In Java, to read input from a user we'll need
the Scanner class. The Scanner class is
defined in the java.util package so we will need
to import that package.

If we want to read input from a user from the
terminal window we would first need to create
a new Scanner object:

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

Next, if we want to display a prompt of "Pick a Number"
to the user we would write:

    System.out.println("Pick a number: ");

Cool, so we ask the user to pick a number but if we want
to do anything with that information we need a place to
store that number. We could do that by typing:

    int number = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());


Now, we would be able to use

      System.out.println()

in combination with "number" to return a message back to the user
based on the number they picked. Below is a simple message we could
write:

    System.out.println("You picked a number that was one less than " + number+1 + ".");

Below is a slightly more involved program that does a good job of illustrating
the basics of interacting with a user. It prompts the user to pick a series
of positive integers and when the user decides to exit, the program calculates
the average of the positive ints entered by the user.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class AverageOfPositiveNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Creating an instance of the Scanner class
        //to read and return user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        //Keeps track of the number of positive integers a user
        //has entered
        int positiveTotal = 0;

        //Keeps track of the sum of the positive integers a user
        //has entered
        int positiveSum = 0;

        System.out.println("Pick a series of positive whole numbers."
                           + '\n'
                           + "We'll tell you the average."
                           +'\n'
                           + "Press Enter after each number."
                           +'\n'
                           + "Pick 0 to Exit:");

        //Repeatedly asks user for number
        while (true) {

            //Reads and stores the number entered by user
            int number = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());

            //Terminates the while loop if user enters 0
            if (number == 0){

                //Only prints if user has not entered any positive numbers
                //Only occurs if user enters 0 as his first number
                if(positiveTotal == 0){

                  System.out.println("Cannot calculate the average");


                }

                break;
            }

            //If user enters a positive int, the value of positiveTotal
            //will be incremented by 1 and the value of positiveSum will
            //be incremented by the number entered. Additionally, if the user picks a
            //negative int they will be re-prompted to pick a positive one.
            if (number > 0 ){

                positiveTotal++;
                positiveSum += number;

            } else {

                System.out.println("Please pick a positive whole number.");
            }
        }

        //Summary output displaying the average of the positive ints
        //entered by user if the user has entered at least one
        //positive int
        if (positiveTotal > 0) {

            System.out.println("The average of the "
                               + positiveTotal
                               + " numbers you entered is: "
                               + (double) positiveSum/positiveTotal);
        }
    }
}
