We've learned a lot about variables. We learn that when declaring
variables we need to initialize them and we can always change their value
later on. However, there may be some variables whose value we do not
want to change once we have declared and initialized them. We want their
values to remind constant throughout the run time of a program. Those variables
are known as constant variables.

A constant variable has all the components of a "regular" variable: a type, an
identifier, and an initial value. However, a constant variable also
has a  Java keyword prefix that let's Java know to treat it as a constant.
That prefix is the word "final". Additionally, by convention, the identifier
for a constant variable should be all uppercase. So if you wanted to write
a program involving the speed of light, you could write the following:

    final int LIGHTSPEED = 186_282;
