Method => a block of code that performs a task
    *To declare a method you only need
        => a return type (void, int, String)
            +primitive return types are lowercase
            +reference return types are uppercase

        => a name ... also referred to as an identifier

        => parentheses ()
            +if the method does not take any arguments
            +the parentheses can be empty
            +otherwise, the parameters for the method will go inside the parentheses
            +in addition, you have to specify the type for each parameter

        => a pair of curly braces
            +they delineate the methods' body
            +the body will house the code the
            +method will execute along with any
            +local variable declarations

Though these are the only required elements to declare a method,
most methods in Java also have an explicit access modifier field.
Method access modifiers dictate whether a method can be accessed
from within or outside of a class or from within or outside of
a package. The four types of access modifiers, both implicit and
explicit are

        => default (implicit access modifier)
            +you do not write out this access modifier. This is just
            +the default modifier when an access modifier of protected,
            +public, or private is not specified

            +can only be accessed within the package it is declared in
            +2nd most flexible access modifier

        => public (explicit)
            +can be accessed outside of the package it is declared in
            +can be accessed outside of the class it is declared in
            +most flexible access modifier

        => private (explicit)
            +can only be accessed from within the class it is declared in
            +most stringent access modifier

        => protected (explicit)
            +can be accessed within the package it is declared in
            +can be accessed outside of the package it is declared in
            +through way of a child class
            +2nd most stringent access modifier


General syntax for declaring a method =>

    Return-type name(parameters (if needed) ) {

        //Code your function will execute
    };

Every Java program is required to have at least one
method => public static void main (String[] args)
    * Every time a Java program is executed, the program's
    main() method gets called and the code inside the
    main methods' body gets executed

Classes in Java use the pascal naming convention in which
every word in the class identifier is capitalized

    =>HereIsOneExample

Methods and variables use the camel case naming convention.
Here, the first word in the method or variable identifier is
lowercase, and every word after the first, if there are any,
is uppercase
