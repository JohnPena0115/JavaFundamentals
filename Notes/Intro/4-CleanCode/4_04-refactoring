Refactoring
-----------

Refactoring => to change the structure of our code without
               changing it's behavior.

His main method currently has 44 lines of code. He is going to
take some of those lines of code and put them in another method.

When refactoring:

    => Look for lines of code that are conceptually related/always go together

        +In his code the, the following variables are
        conceptually related:

            + monthlyInterest and annualInterest
            + numberOfPayments and years(number of years)

       He contends that the logic for calculating the mortgage is currently all over
       the place in his main method and he wants to bring the lines encompassing
       that logic together in a separate method.

    => Repetitive patterns in your code

        +In his code he considers the while loops repetitive

            + The pattern of his while loops
                +An infinite loop followed by a
                +Question followed by a
                +Value being read followed by
                +Data Validation followed by an
                +Error message is the value is invalid

        All the questions asked in his program have this pattern. He wants
        to extract this pattern into its own method.
