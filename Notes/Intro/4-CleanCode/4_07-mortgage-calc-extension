Mosh wants us to extend the mortgage calc program by showing
all the payments throughout the life time of the loan along
with the remaining balance after each payment.

Down below is the formula for calculating the remaining balance
after each payment.

B = L * [(1+c)^n - (1+c)^p ] / (1 + c)^n - 1


L => the loan amount/principal

c => the monthly interest

n => number of payments throughout the lifetime of the loan

p => number of payments made so far

B => the remaining balance on the loan
