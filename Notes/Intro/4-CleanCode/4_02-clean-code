Clean Coding
------------

Encourages us to think of our code the same
way we would think about an idealized
apartment => keep it clean and organized.

Things to Keep in Mind
----------------------

As our programs grow larger we have to break down
our code into smaller chunks. These chunks are
easier to read and understand. Also we can potentially
reuse them in other programs. In theory, programs written
this way are more maintainable and easier to extend.

As he puts it, we going to do open surgery on the
mortgage calculator, restructuring the code step by step.
