Comparison Operators
--------------------

We use comparison operators to compare primitive
values.

For example, if we wanted to compare if two integer
variables store the same value we would use the
equality(==) operator:

    int x = 1;
    int y = 1;
    System.out.println(x == y);

The "x==y" expression is referred to as a boolean expression.
Boolean expression's can only produce values of "true" or "false".

Other types of Comparison Operator's
------------------------------------

!= ... inequality operator

> ... greater than operator

>= ... greater than or equal to operator

< ... less than operator

<= ... less than or equal to operator
