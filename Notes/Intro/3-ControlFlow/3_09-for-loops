A For loops has 4 components: a counter variable,
a boolean condition, a statement that either increments
or decrements the counter variable and a body.

General Form of a For Loop
--------------------------

for (counter variable; boolean condition; incrementer/'decrementer') {

            //Code to be executed if boolean condition
            //evaluates to true
}


The purpose of For loops is to repeat one task many times.
When you think of "repeat one task many times" you probably
think of a monotonous process where no change occurs.
However, with each repetition, the For loop introduces a
slight change through it's counter variable. A For loop's
useful lies in this slight change, as it allows you to
take something monotonous and make it dynamic.

If you could transform an array, a string, a file or even
an array of objects into a book, a For loop would thumb(iterate)
through each page and either perform an action or
look for something that you instructed it to look for and
then perform an action.
