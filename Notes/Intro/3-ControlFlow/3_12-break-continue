"Break" and "Continue" Key Words
--------------------------------

Normally, a loop will terminate when
it's boolean condition evaluates to false.

The break statement allows you terminate a
loop before the boolean condition in the loop
evaluates to false.

If a specified condition occurs a break statement
will terminate the whole loop. In contrast,
a continue statement terminates one iteration
of a loop earlier based on some condition.

In switch statements "break" statements are, the
majority of times, a necessity. In While or For loops,
the "break" and "continue" key words are an add-on that
allow you to fine tune your logic/process.
