The Ternary Operator
--------------------

You could think of a ternary operator like a simplified If
statement. The ternary operator consists of boolean expression
and values that are returned depending on if the boolean
evaluates to true or false.

Below is the general form of a ternary operator:

    (boolean expression) ? "Value if true" : "value if false"

We can use ternary operators when we want to dynamically set
the value of a variable dependent on some condition and we
believe that doing so with an if statement would introduce
unnecessary noise to the code ...


So if we started here

    int income = 120_000;
    String className;
    if (income > 100_000)
        className = "First";
    else
        className = "Economy";


We could migrate here

    int income = 120_000;
    String className = "Economy";
    if (income > 100_000)
        className = "First";


And end up here

    int income = 120_000;
    String className = income > 100_000 ? "First" : "Economy";
