If Statements
-------------

In any programming language if statements are extremely
important because they allow us to make programs that
make decisions based on certain conditions.

If statements have the following general syntax:

    if(boolean expression) {

        //Code to Execute ;

    }

The curly braces help to delineate the if statement's
body. If the body of the if statement only has one
statement the curly braces are not technically required.

The code inside the if statement's body is only executed
if the boolean expression that precedes the body evaluates
to true.
