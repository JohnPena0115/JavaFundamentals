Extending original Mortgage Calc
------------------------------------

=> Wants us to implement some basic error handling.

    +For the Principle, he wants us to make sure that the
     user enters a number within a valid range. He wants
     this range to be between 1_000 and 1_000_000. If
     a user's input is not within this range he wants us to
     re-prompt the user to provide a number within range.


     +For the Annual Interest Rate, he wants us to make sure
      a user enters a number greater than 0 but less than or
      equal to 30.

      +For Period (Years) he want us to implement logic that will
       validate that a user has entered a number that is at least
       1 but no greater than 30.


 This version of the program will be in the MortgageCalc2Main class.
