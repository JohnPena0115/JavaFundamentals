While loops and For loops have the same purpose
and similar forms, however, they are ideally
implemented in different situations.

In general, For loops are best when you know
the number of repetitions/iterations you want
to complete ahead of time.

In contrast, while loops are best when you
don't know the number of repetitions/iterations
you want to complete before hand.

Below is the general form of a while loop ...

while (boolean condition) {

    //code to be executed


}
